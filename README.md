The goal of the project is to create a model that would predict whether an article is fake news or not, based on its title. The source of the data is two sets - one contains only real articles and the other contains only fake articles. Each set contains more than 20,000 records, but only four thousand were used in the project (the first thousand from each set for teaching the algorithm and testing, and the last thousand from each for making new predictions).
Two models were created using two different techniques: Bag of Words and Words Embeddings.
